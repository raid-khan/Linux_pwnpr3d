 * In this test the attacker uses a compromised application to get access to the private

 * In these tests we try to simulate and show how an attacker could get access
 * to the information on a Linux machine using different techniques to get access to the system.
 * These techniques could exploit some vulnerability on the components of the system and
 * can also exploit a na√Øve user that could compromise its access to the system,
 * compromising with these actions the entire system. The motivation of the attacker
 * could be different on each attack and the results of these attacks depends on the
 * target of the attacker.

 /*
 The main problem faced here is simulate an application that have a
 malicious behavior take access of the private data of other
 application in the operative system so the first application
 compromises an user account and then take the data of other
 application on the same user.
 We solve this problen using a vulnerability in one of the
 applications. and with this vulnerability ano application
 gets access to the private data of the other application.
