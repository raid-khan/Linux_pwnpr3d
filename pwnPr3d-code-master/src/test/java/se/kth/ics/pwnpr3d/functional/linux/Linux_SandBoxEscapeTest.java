 * In this test the attacker uses a compromised application to get access to the private
 * data of other application.
 * In these tests we try to simulate and show how an attacker could get access
 * to the information on a Linux machine using different techniques to get access to the system.
 * These techniques could exploit some vulnerability on the components of the system and
 * can also exploit a na√Øve user that could compromise its access to the system,
 * compromising with these actions the entire system. The motivation of the attacker
 * could be different on each attack and the results of these attacks depends on the
 * target of the attacker.

 * The main problem faced here is simulate an application that have a
